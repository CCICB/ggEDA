### Contributing to ggEDA

There are many ways to contribute to ggEDA.

1.  Request features you would like to by [creating new issues on
    github](https://github.com/CCICB/ggEDA/issues)
2.  [Make your visualisation packages ggEDA-compatible]
3.  [Directly contribute to the ggEDA codebase]

#### Make your visualisation packages ggEDA-compatible

If your package produces ggplots that you would like to interactively
link with ggEDA visualisations, consider converting your geoms to their
ggiraph interactive equivalents and adding a data_id based the same
values you supply to ggEDA via the `col_id` argument. That way end-users
can create a data-linked ggEDA plot composed with your packages plots
using patchwork.

A detailed description of cross-linking between ggEDA plots and other
visualisations is available [here].
