A major challenge when visualizing parallel coordinate plots is to choose the order in which axes should be displayed.

This article describes the approach we use for crossing minimisation. Note that there are other approaches that do not explicitly attempt to minimise crossings, but rather order axes based on how informatively they distinguish groups of interest. For example ggEDA supports ordering axes based on how much mutual information they share with the feature being coloured by.

Sometimes however, especially if you're not colouring by a particular column of interest, crossing minimisation is the most sensible approach. Crossing minimimisation is a more complex topic, so we're dedicating a full article to breaking down the approach used in ggEDA. Note crossing minimisation is automatically employed when `order_columns_by = "auto"` and no colouring is applied

Here we describe an approach that involves

1.  For each pair of dimensions, count how many crossings occur. (Could be extended to support axis inversions by inverting the axis, computing crossings again, and taking the minimum, although this is not yet implemented in ggEDA).
2.  Conceptualise this pairwise matrix as a graph, where each dimension is a node, and edge weights are the number of crossings between them. Our problem is finding the 'shortest' (i.e. lowest total crossings) path through the graph that visits each node once.
3.  Convert this to the [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) - depending on the algorithm you use, you may need to add an extra node that is connected to every other node with '0' crossings (to serve as the start-point). We won't need to do this (for reasons that will become clear when we talk about the algorithm)
4.  If the number of dimensions is small (\<8) we can find the optimal axis-order by brute-force. If the number of dimensions is larger (\>=8), we'll use the **repetitive nearest neighbor (rnn)** heuristic approach with two-opt optimisation (**two-opt**), implemented in the\`TSP\` package.

Note the **rnn** + **two-opt** appraoch does NOT guarantee you find the optimal solution, but will run quickly and find near-optimal solutions in most cases, and can be implemented without taking heavy non-R dependencies external dependencies that complicate installation procedures (e.g. the concorde TSP solver).

### Repetitive Nearest Neighbour Algorithm

Nearest Neighbour Tour (nn)

:   A path where the 'next' dimension is always chosen based on which one has the lowest \# of crossings to the current current dimension

Repetitive Nearest Neighbour Algorithm (rnn)

:   Build a separate nearest neighbour tour using each dimension as a starting point. Return only the tour producing the lowest number of crossings

Obviously there are certain configurations of networks where nearest neighbour algorithms will find highly non-optimal paths. To (partially) mitigate this we take our best **rnn** solution and improve it using the **two-opt** (a.k.a pairwise exchange) algorithm. Two-Opt systematically removes and replaces two edges and in the graph. We run a complete 2-opt local search, which will compare every possible valid combination of the swapping mechanism.

## Alternative Metrics to Minimise

We can use the same algorithmic solution to minimise metrics other than number of crossings, including 'approximations' of crossing numbers based on subsets of data (to save time), or the mutual information distance between each pair of dimensions (based on Joe et al. 1989).
