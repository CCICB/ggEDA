* `cols_to_plot` now dictates order of stacking unless `col_sort` argument is supplied and `order_matches_sort=TRUE`.

* Added `beautify_values` and `beautify_function` argument to `ggparallel_options()`
to provide more control over what text is beautified (made more human readable), and how it is reformatted.
