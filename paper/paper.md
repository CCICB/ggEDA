# Summary

Common early quality control checks in data analysis include assessing dataset completeness and evaluataing how different features  interrelate, including both categorical and quantitative variables (e.g., Figure 1A). Visualizing multiple variables simultaneously is useful for detecting multidimensional patterns, often providing the context required to understand missingness or explaining outliers. The gg1d R package facilitates this process by enabling easy visualization of interrelationships between features in a dataset. It allows re-sorting of visualizations by any feature to help draw further insights into the data. For example, in Figure 1A, an outlier in the height data and several missing values are evident. We also demonstrate the use of gg1d on two popular datasets in Figures 1B and 1C, which show the relationships in the Iris dataset and the clustering patterns in the mtcars dataset, respectively. The gg1d package is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/selkamand/gg1d>..

# Statement of Need

GG1D represents a natural addition to the existing landscape of EDA packages in R.
 
- **skimr**: textually describes completeness and summary statistics for individual features in a dataset (1 dimensional perspective)

- **GGally**: graphically describes correlations between each pair of features (2-dimensional perspective)

- **gg1d**: visualises all dimensions in a dataset in a stacked view (n-dimensional perspective)

There are no packages which automatically produces visualisations comparable to GG1D.
